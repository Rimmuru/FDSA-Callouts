# FDSA-Callouts

FDSA Callouts is a fire callout pack intended to be used anywhere in the state of san andreas.

I highly recommend you use ultimate backup and stop the ped along with the cpr script.

FDSA currently featurs 5 callouts with many many updates planned.

Current callouts:
BrushFire (Currently 1 spawn location)
VehicleFire (Can spawn anywhere)
-TBA
-TBA
-TBA

Requirements:
Open All Interiors

Will this be continued in the future?
Yes, though i work long hours and only get 2 days to work on stuff, so updates may be speratic.

Is FDSA open source?
Of course
